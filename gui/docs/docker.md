# Docker

PrAImate GUI Docker images run the web backend with the Node.js runtime. Dependencies are installed with Bun for faster image builds, and the frontend bundle is built with Vite+ (`vp build`).

## Quick Start

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The default compose file binds PrAImate GUI to `127.0.0.1:${PORT:-4839}` and enables host-control mode.

## Contained Mode

Contained mode runs tools inside the container. Use this when projects and agent CLIs are installed in the container image or mounted into it.

Important environment variables:

- `HOST`: bind address, defaults to `0.0.0.0` in the image
- `PORT`: web server port, defaults to `3000` in the image
- `OPENGUI_SERVER_MODE`: deployment mode. Use `combined` to serve API and frontend assets, or `api-only` to serve only `/api/*`.
- `OPENGUI_AUTH_TOKEN`: optional bearer token required for API requests except `/api/health`
- `OPENGUI_ALLOWED_ROOTS`: comma-separated roots the browser/server file picker may access. Use `/` only for fully trusted deployments.

## Host-Control Mode

Host-control mode lets PrAImate GUI call host CLIs through `nsenter`. The compose file enables it with:

```yaml
network_mode: host
pid: host
privileged: true
OPENGUI_HOST_EXEC: "1"
```

The wrapper exposes common commands such as `git`, `opencode`, `claude`, `codex`, `pi`, `node`, `npm`, `pnpm`, `python`, and `rg` through `/usr/local/host-bin`.

Set these variables to match the host user:

- `OPENGUI_HOST_UID`
- `OPENGUI_HOST_GID`
- `OPENGUI_HOST_HOME`
- `OPENGUI_HOST_PATH`

For internet-facing deployments, bind PrAImate GUI to localhost and put HTTPS/auth in front of it.

## API-only Backend

Set `OPENGUI_SERVER_MODE=api-only` to run only the PrAImate GUI Backend API. Non-API routes return 404, while `/api/health` remains public and reports `servesFrontend: false`.

```bash
OPENGUI_SERVER_MODE=api-only OPENGUI_ALLOWED_ROOTS=/ docker compose up -d
```

Use `/` for `OPENGUI_ALLOWED_ROOTS` only when the Backend host is fully trusted, because it allows PrAImate GUI to browse and operate anywhere the Backend process can access.
