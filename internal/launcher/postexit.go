// Post-exit lifecycle. Sits between `cmd.Run()` returning in main() and
// `os.Exit(code)`. Captures the agent's transcript out of its native
// store, runs the rule-based summarizer over it, and persists both
// into the per-launch session dir so the next launch can read them
// (via appendRecentSessionsDirective) and the user can browse them
// from the TUI search screen.

// CapturePostExit is called after the agent process returns. It runs
// transcript capture for whichever AgentID the chat is bound to,
// writes the canonical JSONL into <chat>/sessions/<ts>-<agent>/, and
// generates summary.md / summary.json next to it.
//
// agent is the resolved Agent (with Binary/Version/WpcTarget filled
// in) — caller has it from OpenChat. ws is the chat-as-workspace
// shape. sandboxDir is taken from ws so the capture happens against
// the same cwd the agent ran in. sessionStart should be the wall
// clock from before exec; sessionEnd is "now".
//
// Returns the summary it produced (zero value when nothing was
// captured) and a non-nil error only on unexpected I/O. Locator
// misses and unsupported formats are surfaced via summary.Note, not
// errors — callers shouldn't fail the launch because a transcript
// couldn't be found.
